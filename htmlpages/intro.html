        <p>Facebook is a social media platform that was founded by Mark Zuckerberg and his college roommates in 2004. It began as a way for Harvard University students to connect online and has since grown into one of the largest social networks worldwide.</p>
        
        <p>The platform allows users to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Connect with friends, family, and communities globally.</li>
            <li>Share photos, videos, and updates about their lives.</li>
            <li>Join groups and events based on shared interests or affiliations.</li>
            <li>Follow and interact with public figures, businesses, and organizations.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Facebook's basic goal is to facilitate communication and connections between individuals and communities, regardless of geographical boundaries. It aims to provide a platform where people can engage, share, and discover content that matters to them.</p>
