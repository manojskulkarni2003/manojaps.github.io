            Facebook is a social media platform that was founded by Mark Zuckerberg
            and his college roommates in 2004. It began as a way for Harvard
            University students to connect online and has since grown into one of
            the largest social networks worldwide.
        </p>

        <p>The platform allows users to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Connect with friends, family, and communities globally.</li>
            <li>Share photos, videos, and updates about their lives.</li>
            <li>
                Join groups and events based on shared interests or affiliations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Follow and interact with public figures, businesses, and
                organizations.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Facebook's basic goal is to facilitate communication and connections
            between individuals and communities, regardless of geographical
            boundaries. It aims to provide a platform where people can engage,
            share, and discover content that matters to them.[1]
